        I live in a house. I like my house very much. It’s neither big nor little. When you enter the house you see a big living room. There is a sofa and a round table in the middle of the living room. There is a big TV-set on the wall. My living room is light as there are 4 big windows. There is a kitchen to the right and stairs to the upper floor. The kitchen is big, and the whole family can get together for dinner there. My parents also like to invite their friends for dinner.
        My room is upstairs. It’s big, with high ceilings. There is not much furniture there, only my bed, my wardrobe and a couple of shelves. I keep my pets in the room. I have many of them: mice, rats, hamsters, fish, parrots. I even have a ferret. So there are cages all over the room. My parents’ room, my elder sister’s room, my younger brother’s room and my granny’s room are also upstairs.
        There is a yard around the house. My granny likes to grow flowers there. My dad made a small sports ground with a horizontal bar and a punch bag. There is a swing opposite the sports ground.
        There is a garage for our car and my dad’s tools. We also keep our bikes there.
        A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for an individual, group or family. It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered spaces for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing. Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space.[1] The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales, from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.

        A principle of constitutional law in many countries, related to the right to privacy enshrined in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [2] is the inviolability of the home as an individual's place of shelter and refuge.

        The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines - topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics. Such topics can be found in the writings of Gaston Bachelard, Jean Baudrillard, Mrs Isabella Beeton, Pierre Bourdieu, Beatriz Colomina, Le Corbusier, Mary Douglas, Diana Fuss, Dolores Hayden, Martin Heidegger, Henri Lefebvre, Edith Wharton amongst many others.[3] Discussions of home can help better understand and challenge perceptions of self and the extension of self.

        Places of residence do not necessarily correlate with associations to the home; the home consists of a physical space as well as an emotional and psychological relationship, where memory, comfort, activity and familiarity are some of the many important factors in the construction of home.[4] Amongst being a space of domestic activity the home in the 21st century has appropriated new meanings with the advance of technology, therefore enabling multiple activities to be performed within a singular space. The home blurs boundaries of the domestic, the professional and the leisurely and conceptually becomes an amorphous space.[5]

        The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.
